# Demo 01
This is a complete application demo. Its purpose is to demonstrate how to use the various high-level classes such as `server::application`, `html::page` and `html::form`.

Everything has been kept to a (decent) minimum. The application doesn't perform error & sanity checking in areas which
would be crucial for any real-world production-ready application.
